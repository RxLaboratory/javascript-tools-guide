the ExtendScript reflection interface.
A localization utility for providing user-interface string values in different languages. See Localizing
ExtendScript strings.
Global functions for displaying short messages in dialog boxes. See User notification dialogs.
An object type for specifying measurement values together with their units. See Specifying
